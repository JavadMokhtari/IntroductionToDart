/* 
Asynchronous programming in Dart allows you to write code that can perform long-
running operations, such as network requests or file I/O, without blocking the 
programâ€™s execution. This is achieved through the use of "Future"s and "Stream"s
which represent values that will be available at some point in the future.

A Future represents a single value that will be available at some point in the 
future. You can use the "async" and "await" keywords to write asynchronous code 
that looks similar to synchronous code. For example, you can use await to wait 
for a Future to complete before continuing with the next line of code.

}

// Define Future function

void main(List<String> args) async {
  /*
  Create a Future that will complete with the string value after a delay of two 
  seconds. Using the "then" method to register a callback that will be called 
  when the Future completes.

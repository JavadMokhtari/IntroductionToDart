Abstract class
# The abstract class may or may not have abstract methods i.e. it can have 
either abstract or concrete methods.
# A class declared as abstract canâ€™t be initialized.
# An abstract class can be extended, but if you inherit it then you have to make
sure that all the abstract methods in it are provided with implementation.

/*
Mixin:
A "mixin" is a class with methods and properties utilized by other classes. In 
other words, are regular classes from which we can grab methods (or variables) 
without having to extend them. It allows you to add extra features to classes in
a way that standard class inheritance doesnâ€™t allow. To accomplish this, we use 
the "with" keyword.
